# Photogallery-On-PHP

Simple photogallery based on PHP

## General idea behind the Photogallery On PHP

I needed for some of my project web gallery which is automatically generated from directory structure with photos. Therefore I created simle photogallery based on PHP. 

## How it works?

In one private folder (which is not directly exposed to the Internet) you just needs to configure photogallery (enter some information, password, upload photos) and into another folder, which is directly exposed to the Internet, you upload PHP source codes of photogallery. 

## Getting the Photogallery on PHP

Run ```git clone git@github.com:antonbalucha/photogallery-on-php``` command from your console, which supports GIT (e.g. https://git-scm.com/downloads)
